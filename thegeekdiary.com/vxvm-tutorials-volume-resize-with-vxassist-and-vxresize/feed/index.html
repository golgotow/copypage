		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sandeep,
Nice one,
seems with vxlist we can find the DG/vol current size and even free space of DG. so what is the diff between vxlist and vxmax size ?
Also how to check volume free space if volume is not mounted ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sandeep,

Thank you very much for all the assistance.  We&#039;ve successfully extended the vol and FS.  Our only remaining problem right now is that the FS is using version 4 which has a size limitation of 1TB.

Thanks again!]]></description>

One more question is it ok to add a new LUN with a different size (a much bigger one) compared to the existing disks that is a member of the diskgroup?]]></description>
