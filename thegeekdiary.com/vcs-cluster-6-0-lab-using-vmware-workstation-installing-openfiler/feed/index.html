		<description><![CDATA[Hello, 
Firstly I would like to thank you for great posts about Solaris, I have learnt a lot. 
In terms of this VCS setup, it is also a great tutorial for beginners in VCS world but
I have faced one problem with this config while configuring OpenFiler. It&#039;s really easy soft to install and configure but has some problems with PR (has problems or does not have support at all,  I&#039;m not sure). So I recommend either FreeNAS or simply LIO with targetcli on Linux to set this up. Unfortunately I didn&#039;t manage to configure this with OpenFiler. 
Thanks again for a great blog :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Sandeep, something I noticed when following your steps:

When creating the OpenFiler VM, the type should be CentOS, not FreeBSD.. FreeBSD is used when configuring FreeNAS, which you probably have done at some point or another.

Great work documenting this so thoroughly, by the way! :)
