		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sandeep,

Good work .. Thank you.

You covered most of the needed things for SMF, however inetadm and inetd ( Delegated restarter) may need to include .


Excerpt from one Oracle Doc:

=====================================
Administering Network Services with inetadm
The management of built-in network services in the Solaris 10 OS is now handled through SMF. The
Internet services daemon, inetd(1M), has been rewritten as a part of SMF, and configuration data for
network services is now stored in the SMF repository rather than in /etc/inet/inetd.conf. This allows
the SMF tools to be used to control and observe inetd-based network services.
Any records remaining in /etc/inet/inetd.conf after an OS upgrade to the Solaris 10 OS, or later
created by installing additional software, must be converted to SMF and imported into the SMF repository
using inetconv(1M) — otherwise the service will not be available. To provide compatibility for services
which have not yet been converted to SMF, entries can be added to inetd.conf using traditional syntax,
and the utility inetconv will convert the new services to SMF. The command inetconv should always be
run after changing /etc/inet/inetd.conf. Note that inetconv is run automatically during the first reboot
after an OS installation or upgrade. If inetd.conf has been modified since inetconv was run, then inetd
sends reminder messages to syslog.
After inetd.conf has converted a service, inetadm can be used to change properties of the converted
service. The SMF utilities (such as svcs, svcadm, etc.) can also be used to observe the service and perform
common actions.
