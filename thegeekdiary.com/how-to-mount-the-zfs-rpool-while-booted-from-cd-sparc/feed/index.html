		<description><![CDATA[This post is still a valid way of mounting when rpool fails to mount even with the method you mentioned. I have seen cases when it doesn&#039;t mount with failsafe. In that case the method in the post is the only way to mount rpool. You can refer the official doc here - http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19253-01/819-5461/gjpna/index.html. By the way thanks for reminding me to add the failsafe method too. I&#039;ll do that soon in the same post.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sandeep.


I think that the post it&#039;s very useful for the old school sysadmin, but in Soaris 10 update 9 sparc, have a failsafe mode, and when you are in OBP, you can boot with  this command, boot -F failsafe, and you boot a miniroot, an automatically moun rpool in /a.
