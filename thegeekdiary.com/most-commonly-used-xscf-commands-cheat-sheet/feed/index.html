		<description><![CDATA[Hi.
Great article, clear presentation. I&#039;ve just discovered your website and it&#039;s a great help for me.
This is tipically the reason why i don&#039;t like Sun (sorry Oracle). I&#039;m mainly talking about the consoles here.
The changes in hardware means so much unecessary complexity IMHO ... i&#039;m so happy i&#039;m working on Linux now in virtual env (i know there&#039;s still hardware somewhere but at least i&#039;m not the one struggling with that anymore).
I&#039;m here just to get ready for a job interview where the client has some remaining Oracle hardware. He is on his way to migrate all that to Linux though (good for me).
I don&#039;t want to troll but i never understood why such great people at Sun/Oracle would do some crazy stuff like this ... this is called reinventing the wheel.]]></description>
