		<description><![CDATA[Sandip,

Thanks for your wonderful and clear article 

I want to know how can we configure the physical dedicated interface on solaris 11 zone and do  link based ipmp in zone.

====================
Thanks and Regards,

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks HeartPassions,

You should definitely go for &lt;strong&gt;Link based IPMP&lt;/strong&gt; in this case. Use the 2 interface like :

&lt;img src=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E35434_01/html/E23807/figures/122157a.png&quot; alt=&quot;IPMP configuration for LDOMs&quot; /&gt;

Make sure you set the linkprop=phys-state on the vnet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HI Sandeep

I have another issue, i need to install 2 Ldoms on solaris 11 box, and i have only 2 interface which i can use for these Ldoms, i also need to create IPMP . what is the best practice in this case?

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;why we are using only 1 IP address for the ipmp interfaces?&lt;/strong&gt;
Link based IPMP uses interface kernel driver to check the status of the interface. whereas in probe based IPMP, ICMP probe messages on test address are sent to external targets to check the status of the interface. Thus in Link based IPMP we don&#039;t assign any IP addresses to the interface as it does not depend on any external target to confirm that the interface has failed.

&lt;strong&gt;can we give IP address to net1 and net2 and ipmp0 will have another ip?&lt;/strong&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[Hi
Thanks for the wonderful article.
i am new to solaris 11 but worked little with solaris 10... I am confused why we are using only 1 IP address for the ipmp interfaces?
as per my knowledge of solaris 10, for ipmp we have 2 separate IP address for the physical interface and 1 test IP address which is virtual.

i need to undertand why the ifconfig -a output shows the  IP address 0.0.0.0 for net1 and net2 and ipmp0 is having 192.168.1.10  ipaddress

can you plz explain this?


or can we give IP address to net1 and net2 and ipmp0 will have another ip?

Thanks alot .]]></description>
