		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sandeep,

Excellent work !!!! everything is explained in a very simple manner . Good Job :-)

I have a question , I have tried a similar setup and everything went smooth till an issue occurred .

Solaris 10 on VMware workstation 10 crashes with 4 NIC&#039;s , once I remove the 4th NIC , the O/S behaves normally .

Could you please let me know your thoughts on this , I would be happy to hear your response .

I was trying to set up the cluster.Facing some issue.Do both the VM&#039;s have the same IP address? 
I can see both VMs have the same IP&#039;s and now both are not pinging to each other.]]></description>
